<!-- Career Information Section -->
<section class="container my-5">
  <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Popular Careers in Music</h2>
  <div>
    <h5>Vocalist / Singer</h5>
    <p>Perform songs across genres — from playback to live concerts. Focus on training your voice, expression, and stage performance. 
    A career as a vocalist requires consistent practice, vocal health maintenance, and collaboration with music producers and composers. 
    Opportunities include playback singing, live performances, choir singing, and independent artistry on digital platforms. 
    With social media and streaming platforms, independent singers can reach a global audience and build their brand.</p>

    <h5>Composer / Songwriter</h5>
    <p>Create original melodies and lyrics. Requires understanding of musical theory, harmony, and digital audio workstations (DAWs). 
    Composers work for films, advertisements, and gaming studios or as independent creators. 
    Songwriters often collaborate with singers and producers, and strong storytelling through lyrics is key. 
    Creativity, emotional intelligence, and networking with the industry can help composers establish a lasting career.</p>

    <h5>Music Producer</h5>
    <p>Oversee the entire music production process — mixing, mastering, and sound design. Requires technical and creative skills. 
    Producers act as both technicians and visionaries, helping artists translate musical ideas into finished tracks. 
    Mastery of DAWs such as Logic Pro or Ableton Live is essential. A good producer understands sound trends, manages studio sessions, and maintains a creative yet organized workflow.</p>

    <h5>Performance (Musicians & Singers)</h5>
    <p>Perform live on stage or in studios as instrumentalists or vocalists. Develop stage presence and collaborate with other artists. 
    Performing artists can specialize in specific genres like classical, pop, jazz, or fusion. 
    Success in this field demands not only musical excellence but also confidence, audience engagement, and versatility. 
    Frequent practice, networking, and exposure to live audiences help performers grow professionally.</p>

    <h5>Production (Producers & Audio Engineers)</h5>
    <p>Shape the sound of music through recording, editing, and mixing. Work with modern DAWs and studio equipment. 
    Audio engineers ensure sound quality and balance in both studio and live performances. 
    The field offers opportunities in studios, film production, television, gaming, and podcasts. 
    Strong technical skills and a good ear for detail make this career highly rewarding for those passionate about sound.</p>

    <h5>Music Business (Agents, Publicists, Managers)</h5>
    <p>Handle marketing, contracts, and artist management. Bridge the gap between art and commerce in the music world. 
    These professionals negotiate deals, organize tours, and handle branding for artists. 
    Knowledge of media, public relations, and legal aspects of music is essential. 
    It’s ideal for those who enjoy working behind the scenes and supporting creative talent to reach larger audiences.</p>

    <h5>Education (Teachers & Therapists)</h5>
    <p>Inspire others through teaching or use music therapy to promote well-being. Requires compassion and musical understanding. 
    Music educators work in schools, colleges, or private institutes, while music therapists use rhythm and melody to aid emotional and physical healing. 
    Both careers are fulfilling paths that merge art and human connection, with growing demand in academic and healthcare institutions alike.</p>

    <h5>Technical & Production Skills</h5>
    <p>Music today isn’t just about instruments — it’s about technology too.

Knowing how to record, mix, and master your songs will make your work sound polished and professional.</p>
    <h5>Performance & Communication Skills</h5>
